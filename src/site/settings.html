            <br/>
            The number of minutes to wait between syncing your autoplaylists with Google.
            <br/>
            Lower numbers sync more often, keeping playlists more accurate at the cost of more ui refreshes, higher mobile battery use, and danger of problems on Google's end.
            <br/>
            Setting this lower than 10 minutes is not recommended.
            <br/>
            Set to zero to disable periodic syncing. You can still sync manually with the "sync now" button.
            <br/>
            Regardless of this setting, changing an autoplaylist definition will always sync that playlist immediately.

            <input type="text" id="sync-minutes" class="form-control"/>

        <p id="settings-explanation">
            <label for="batching-enabled">enable change batching</label>
            <br/>
            Enabled by default, this splits large syncs into multiple smaller sync requests.
            <br/>
            This spreads out load on Google, making syncs succeed more often at the cost of more ui refreshes.
